# The concept

  

- Our extension would allow visually impaired people to hear the content of web pages, and to navigate through them with the fewest possible keys on the keyboard and eventually with a voice assistant like Siri for the most severe cases.
- Once the user arrives on the site of his choice, he can navigate between the content blocks (div, section, etc ...) to have them read by a voice assistant and the latter can propose several actions during his reading (go to a link, click on a button, fill out a form ...) by validating by pressing the enter key.

  

  

# Project management (GitHub)

  

  

- Milestone definition (in the form of user-story), grouping together automated issues (functionalities), referenced in the GitHub Kanban.

  

- Gitflow Workflow (each feature has its branch) :

# Resources

- As we don't have any particular knowledge in extension development, we will need several resources and documentation to help us to train ourselves to do this task.
